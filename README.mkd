This package represents a script to install the latest NginX, MySQL and PHP (with APC and Suhosin).
Note: At this moment the Suhosin extension is not available for PHP 5.4.
You can install your preferred versions for any of the programs. Just edit the OPTIONS file and change them accordingly.

It is highly recommended to run this installer on a fresh installed system.
This is tested with Ubuntu 10.04, 11.10 and 12.04, both 32 bits and 64 bits, on official Amazon EC2 Ubuntu images.

# HOW TO: #

Make sure you have Git installed on your Ubuntu System:

    sudo apt-get install git-core screen

Clone this repository, and get the latest stable version of this script:

    git clone git://github.com/vladgh/VladGh.com-LEMP.git
    cd VladGh.com-LEMP

Start a screen session:

    screen

I recommend running everything inside a screen session because if your connection drops you can easily come back with `screen -rad`. If you use something else (ex: byobu) you can skip this step.

Edit the OPTIONS files and change `ENABLED='yes'`. This is were you can chose to install the MySQL Server or modify the versions for any of the programs, as well as the paths.

Run the installer:

    sudo ./install.sh

After the installer is finished (this will take a long time depending on your server specifications), you MUST set your mysql root password:

    sudo mysqladmin -u root password MYPASSWORD

You can go to your server's address and you will see the PHP info page.
Also, if you go to:

  * **http://example.com/apc.php** you will find the APC Cache information page;
  * **http://example.com/nginx_status** for the NginX statistics;
  * **http://example.com/status?html** for the FPM statistics.

In order to have immediate access to new paths you should also execute `source /etc/environment`. This command reloads the new environment variables.

# Utilities: #
In the "ext" folder you will also find some utilities:

* `nxensite` and `nxdissite` commands to enable or disable sites in NginX (similar to a2ensite and a2dissite in Apache).
* `update_nginx.sh` script which you can use to upgrade the current nginx.
  * you can run it with `sudo env PATH=$PATH bash ext/update_nginx.sh 1.0.4` (as you can see there are a few things worth mentioning: you need to declare the current path to the sudo command in order to preserve it; you can only have one argument in a strict form x.x.x; )
  * this script is doing nothing more than reconstructing you current nginx config with the new version. It gets the previous configure options programmatically so if you used 3rd party modules it will not work. Also it saves the current config files and brings them back after the compilation was successful.
* `update_php.sh` - upgrades the current php (`sudo env PATH=$PATH bash ext/update_php.sh 5.3.10`).
* `update_apc.sh` - upgrades the current apc (`sudo env PATH=$PATH bash ext/update_apc.sh 3.1.19`).

The formatting conventions already present in these scripts are as follows:

* Unix (LF), not dos (CRLF) line endings.
* Two space indentation ([GNU Style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#GNU_style)).
